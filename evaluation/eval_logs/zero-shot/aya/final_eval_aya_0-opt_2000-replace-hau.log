Yes.�

Numbers of the positive and negative components are equal to each other in both cases.

Amfani�

The positive component is more significant than that of the negative one because it has an element called'sus' which means 'happy'. The negative aspect on the other hand does not contain any such word but instead contains words like ‘dire', ''baffled'' and so forth. This indicates that there was something bad about what happened before (in case of the negative), while at the same time suggesting that things will be different from now onwards as long as we remember our faithfulness towards God's law.���������������������������������������

Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia. The government has been providing assistance through various means including food rations for children under five years old as well as medical supplies such as antibiotics and oxygen concentrators. However, there are still many who need help according to reports from local sources. "The situation is very critical," said Habibu Abdi, head of the Red Cross Society in Mogadishu. He added that some 10 million Somalials have gone without water or nutritious foods since April due to lack of rainfall. As a result, he warned, an estimated 1.5 million more will become affected by hunger this year if no action is taken immediately. In addition, another 2.2 million may be cut off from access to clean drinking water because they do not own any piped water systems at home. Despite these challenges, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud congratulated Iranian citizens across his country during Eid al-Fitr prayers last week over their successful efforts towards addressing the current crises facing Somalia. According Toeghlian, it would be impossible to give up hope when faced with so much hardship but we must continue our work until every person can live comfortably." It was also noted that while Iran sends its support directly into Somalia, other countries like China, India, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan,
