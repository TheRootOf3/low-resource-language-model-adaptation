Does this Amharic statement; "obodo à wu igwe" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only  indicate the positive/negative nature of their meaning.

Nkebi: It is an expression that indicates how one feels about something in life and what they would like to do with it (i.e., whether you are happy or disappointed). This phrase can be used as either a greeting for someone else or even when discussing your own situation. For example, if you were't expecting anything from them but received some unexpected kindness then this could mean that things will go well between both parties going forward. On the other hand, if everything went badly after receiving such kind words then there's no hope left on your part because nothing good comes out of negative situations.

o: The word 'iro' means yes while 'ingosi' means no. So whenever you hear phrases like these, always use the correct verb form. You don’'t want people thinking that you're just being nice by saying those sentiments without having any real intention behind them!
