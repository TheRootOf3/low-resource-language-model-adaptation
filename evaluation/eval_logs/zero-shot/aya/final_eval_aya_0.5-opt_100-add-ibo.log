The news that will interest you:  The government of India has decided to ban all imports from Bangladesh for one year, starting April 1, 2021. This decision was taken after a spate of attacks on Indian nationals by Bangladeshi terrorists and their supporters across various parts of West Bengal since November 2020. It is also being alleged that some members of this group have been operating out of Dhaka district under the protection of local gangs. During these months, several incidents were reported where individuals belonging to different ethnic groups including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, etc., attacked each other with machetes or sticks over petty disputes such as parking spaces at bus stops, encroachment of public property like footpaths, garbage dumps, water-pipes, etc.; even though they are not related to any political party/organisation; leading to casualties among both communities. In addition, there had been reports about extortion demands made against those who fail to pay them money within stipulated time frames. These acts resulted into tensions between two separate socetietiies which eventually led to an uprising called 'Shaheen Bazar' (Hindu Bazaar) in December last year. Since then, many more cases involving similar crimes have come forth during the course of investigation. However, due to fear psychosis induced
