Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?

Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?
Answer: He was born April 27th 1942, making him 42 years-old then.
The previous que asked abo how long it took them until they had their own cars; here we are asking what happened after that initial excitement faded away. They got into two more vehicles before getting one of their very own—the Benz 350 Dauphine II. It wasn’�t quite as fast or powerful as the Benz 3500 but it did have all the features necessary for daily commuters like safety belts, ail mirror shades, and power operated door locks. In additionally, there were no automatic doors either! This car would be known by its unique appearance alone rather than any practicality. 
Madukas parents weren‘t exactly supportive of this decision so he eventually sold half of the shares in order to finance building the rest of the model line. When the time came to launch the Benz 350D in May 1984, everyone who received pre-order orders from dealerships around Europe turned out en masse because each unit cost over N200k ($250). Since then, every new Benz has been built using the same engine architecture, meaning that these models continue to use the 2¼L V8 developed specifically for the German market.

Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Answer: No. It says "Madukay" instead of "Charity," as it should have been pronounced.
Here are some more details abo the strt-Up: 
The project was initiated by Maximilien Dessalines, who had formed a partnership earlier this year called MaxxDessaline & Company Limitedge Services Ltd., after surviving being involved in two previous flops. In April 1921, Dessalin announced plans to create a new car brand based upon Benz Benz Engineerin, but faced widespread oppression from other German firms due to its low price tag compared to traditinger vehicles made by them. After several months' worth of research into engine design techniques, Dessalan eventually produced what would become known as the Benz 350 Solution, or Sttep 400, while continuously tryinggleging against all odds despite repeated setbacks. This achievement led to further investment in development efforts, leading ultimately to the creation of the Benz Benz 350SOLtion in 1922. During these years, Dasslianne created numerous prototypes including one named the Benz 3500, which never saw production because of technical problems related to fuel management systems. Despite their failure, however, the Benz 350 series became quite successful over

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she saw blood on her clothes as well as in a trash bag inside their house along with other evidence indicating they had been attacked by someone or something earlier this afternoon. The two women then went downstairs while starting for help but were unable to locate anyone who could assist them. They eventually managed to get into another room where there was more noise coming out of it so they shut themselves up again until further notice when one woman came back down asking if everyone is all right. When he answered yes, she urged him to come outside because she heard noises like dogs being trained at an area near his property line. He agreed and soon thereafter appeared armed with what loo like small knives which turned out to be haniltons made entirely of wood. In response, the men fired several rounds towards him before turning away immediately after seeing red threads within the material. This incident has left many people talking abo how unsafe these houses are withoutustinglufe.
