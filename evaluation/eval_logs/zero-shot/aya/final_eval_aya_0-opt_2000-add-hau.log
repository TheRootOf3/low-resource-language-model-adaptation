Answer: No. A yanking Niger has been part of Italy for more than 1000 years before it became independent from France. It's also known as "Niger" or "Najeriya". 
Jahar 'Anmbra' (pronounced Jaha) means “�Land’” in Yoruba language. Sojojin ‘Yaraduu necessanger of Nagera land”. This refers to the Kingdom of Ibadah which later turned into Najeriya when its ruler Muhammadu Sanusi came over there after his defeat at battle agas the Ottoman Empire.

Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia. The leader noted that "The situation is getting worse by day." He added: “We are facing an emergency with which we must tak action.” In his speech he also called for international cooperation against terrorism as well as efforts towards peacekeeping throughout the region. Additly, referring to the current refugee issue at Europe's southern border, the President sai: "This should not have happened if our governments had been more respsible". 
In response to this call from the government of Ira, many members of the community came out en masse to help their neighbors across the Red Sea. They carried water bottles, food parcels, blankets, tents, etc., along with them when they left home or were dropped off at designated points around Somaliland. These volunteers made it easier for those who did come into contact with these strangers to get through the night without having to worry abo where their next meal was coming from. Many individuals even took time away from work or school just so they could be there to support each other. This gesture has contributed significantly to reducing stress levels among some residents while providing much needed relief to others affected by the ongoing circumstances. It can be seen here how the local population responded to the request from the leadership of

(a) Amzon - This entity's name appears at the top left corner when you open its profile page. It has no apparent function or purpose but it does not have any negative value either.
(b) Amzon - The second entity with positive values here is also known by various other names such as "Amzon" or "Amaro." Its primary role seems to be data collection between different systems within Amazon. There are several versions across multiple locations which may contain information from one system into another depending upon their specific roles. However, there do appear to exist some common threads throughout these variations. For instance, they tend towards collaboration rather than conflict management; they often use standardised interfaces like Java or C++ libraries instead of custom ones made specifically for them; and many seem to run under Windows environments whereas others might work well obtade OS X/UnixOs. They can sometimes even support external applications through APIs such as Microsoft SQL Server or MySQL. Their internal workingsings aren't exactly public knowledge so I'll leave those details out until we get deeper into our analysis process.
