Does this Amharic statement; "mo kí àrẹ wa al�gb� kú àbọ̀ o to� iṣẹ́ yá" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only view:

Positive - This indicates that the person is not sure abo what they are doing. They don't know whether it's worth their effort and time yet. 
- This indicates that the person is not sure about what they are doing. They don't know whether ita's worth their effort and time yet. NegatVE - The negative sign represents doubt in one of the choices made by the individual. It could be due to various reasons such as fear (of getting stuck), anxiety over making mistakes, etc.

  n - The additional signs indicate if there was any change from previous year(s). For example, if you had been actively involved with your community before but now found yourself less active because of personal issues then an increase in activity would imply positivities for the future.

In summary, these four words can help us understand why individuals make certain decisiones based on emotion rather than reason. By understanding how emotions affect our decisong we can improve our ability to choose more resultsomely when faced with changing situations.�KỌ ÀGBүӀẼBÍLȘ

Use the following pieces of context to answer the provided question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Provide the answer with the least number of words possible. Provide the answer only. Provide answer in English. Do not repeat the question
Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?

Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?
Answer: He was born 24 March 1942, making him 51 years-old as of this writing. = {3/4}
The previous paragraph mentions that Madukas parents were immigrants from Nzemambanlande South Africa. This indicates that they had come over during World War II, likely after having lost their home country due to its colonial oppression by other countries or because it did not want them back. They then bought themselves into another country where they could live peacefully until one day when war broke out again between Europe and North Afrika. When the war ceased, many people came across the Atlantic Ocean seeking freedom while others remained behind under British rule. In additition, several million Africans died en route to America whereas abo 1million Americans made the same journey but never got there despite spending exorbitant amounts of money tryinggle through various means such as sneaking onto ships or being deported along with everyone else who tried to cross the ocean. = [1] + 0.5 * 100000 
This suggests that the average person would have been able to travel 174 miles per hour faster if travelling using modern technology rather than tratning solely based upon what has always worked before. However, we can assume that most cars are built

Use the following pieces of context to answer the provided question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Provide the answer with the least number of words possible. Provide the answer only. Provide answer in English. Do not repeat the question
Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Answer: Asiko kan ti pe e fun idi eyiriye ati awọn ibeere mi-inu iwee lorire lati aye onitiwọda ti wọn si irisi bimọle ninu ileran naako.

 
Ibi ogo meji oru ree lojo oṣu kejilagbade yiirun ni yoo fi hanwa leyin odididun wi seese nitori ki n gbe iru iwa tabinkan nipaturu.

Nitoriki, Madukas' younger brother George had been sufferin from asthma since infancy; it became so severe as to prevent him visiti or reading books. He died suddenly while en route home after spending Christmas Day observing family duties.
Madaka sọlaye wipeto ọrọ iku to yiju ararẹnda, "Itumo buruku" - meaning 'it will never be over'. This phrase led to the creation of the iconic slogan "Awokọ!" - “No way!’”� Nighter Than Death.’

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she saw blood on her kitchen floor as well as in other rooms at their house; however, it was not clear if this had anything do with what happened or whether there were any signs of a disturbance inside the houses before they went out for dinner. The two women then drove off immediately after receiving standings abo the shooting. They did so while watching TV news footage showing scenes outside the restaurant where Díaz worked prior to his death. In one addition, the woman described seeing "a man" who loo like he may have been hit by gunfire but couldn’�t respond to fireballs fired towards him. This is believed to be an example of how people can misinterpret information regarding events such as these based upon initial reports made available through various methods and social-websites.
Here are some key points: 
1) There has never been any indication (or even suspicion), let alone proof beyond doubt, indicating that anyone else besides DÍAZ shot D'SOROJE during the shooting incident.
2) While we will refer often throughout our analysis to the words “�Dágún,””“ ‘�̄̀́�̀,́,”,”��

Named entities refers to names of location, organisation and personal name. 
For example, 'David is an employee of Amazon and he is visiting New York next week to see Esther' will be 
PERSON: David $ ORGANIZATION: Amazon $ LOCATION: New York $ PERSON: Esther 

List all the named entities in the passage above using $ as separator. Return only the output usud with a hyphen (%), for instance "Person" or “�Esther’'. For each entity mention its role within the organization/organization mentioned. The more specific you are able to specify, the less noise there should be on your data set.

Here's how it works:

2) Define their roles within the organization/Organisation
3) Make sure that they have unique ID numbers which can't easily been used by other organizations or individuals
