Does this Amharic statement; "obodo à wu igwe" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only  indicate the positive and negative aspects of speech.

Noun: A word spoken by an individual that is intended to be understood as being in agreement with another person's words (spoken aloud). It can also include instructions for doing something specific when given orally.

 Noun: The noun form of a verb used before adjectives like 'to' or 'in'. For example, 'a-mọ nné ákwàrè mákwú okwutù', means 'it has been said.' This sentence indicates that it was just heard from someone else who had not yet made up their mind about what they are going to do next week.

Adjective: An adverbial phrase added after a verb which describes how one thing should go if done correctly. For example, 'biko na isi gasịrị ụzọ kamanya ya ọ bụ ihe mere ka esi ekperegwuide gị hapụ makpụta dị ọnya.' Meaningful phrases such as these help make certain actions more explicit so people know exactly where things need to occur at any particular point during the course of action.

Vocabulary: Words commonly found within English sentences but often left out because they don't

The news that will interest you: The government of India has decided to ban all imports from Bangladesh and Nepal for one year, following a series of attacks on Indian citizens by militants across their border with those countries. This decision comes after several such incidents were reported over recent months. It is also being speculated that this move may be part of an attempt at containing cross-border terrorism between these two nations. However, it remains unclear whether or not there was any specific intelligence indicating potential threats towards Indians living along both sides of the international boundary line (IBL). During his press conference yesterday evening, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said he had been briefed about "specific" information regarding possible terror strikes against Indian nationals within the country's borders. He added that while no concrete evidence could yet substantiate claims made during previous briefings, authorities have nonetheless taken measures like banning certain items under suspicion as well as carrying out raids inside Bangladeshi cities where terrorists are believed to operate. In its statement issued today, the Ministry of External Affairs confirmed reports related to the planned import bans but did not specify when they would take effect. Officials stated that details relating to timing and modalities of implementation remain pending due to ongoing negotiations among various stakeholders involved in implementing the measure. A senior official told reporters earlier today that officials from different ministries including
