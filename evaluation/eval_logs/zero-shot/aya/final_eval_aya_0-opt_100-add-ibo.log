Does this Amharic statement; "obodo à wu igwe" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only  indicate the positive/negative nature of that word.

Noun: Aha (a noun) in English language is used to describe something as being 'observed' by someone else. It can be either singular or plural and it has no gender. The pronoun form for an object like 'you', 'it's you', etc., are all forms of 'an'.

 Nouns with a possessive suffix - e.g.'my car', 'your dog', 'his bike'--are called adjectives while those without one- add "-ous". For example, 'her cat' becomes 'Her Cat.' This article explains how these words work together.

Adjectives do not need any additional modifiers before them when they're spoken out loud but their usage depends on what type of situation we find ourselves in at the time. Here's some examples from our everyday life...

1. I'm walking down the street towards my friend who lives next door. She turns around after hearing me coming closer because she doesn't want anyone getting hurt! 2. My boss comes up behind me during his lunch break and starts screaming about how he wants more money than ever since he was fired last week 3. During dinner conversation between siblings, each person
