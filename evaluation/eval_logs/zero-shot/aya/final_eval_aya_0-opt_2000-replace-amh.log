This sentence has an 'amhara' meaning. It is positive in the sense that it describes what happened to the person who wrote it and negative in the sense of expressing regret for something they did not do well enough at some point in their life. This word also means "to be happy" but can mean either positively (as with ') or negatively ("). The phrase '@user ክብዎ ነውምን በአልተት ጥር ከጥ የሚገበትትን መቼ ነበር እ�ላለች።?' refers to someone's reaction when he/she saw his/her friend fall ill after eating too much food while on vacation.

Translate the English sentence below to Amharic. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today. The amendments include a ban on publishing information that is considered offensive or incitingent, as well as restrictions on access to websites hosting content deemed obscene or pornographic. They also prohibit any publication of material containing "incendiary" language such as racial slurs or anti-Islamic remarks. In addition, they mandate an annual licensing fee for all journalists working under government control; it will be paid out of their salaries until 2023. These measures are part of efforts taken since 2013 following mass protests against President Bashar al Assad's regime over human rights abuses, including torture and rape allegations. Critics have said these laws could stifle political dissent while emboldening authoritarian leaders like King Abdullah II who has been known to use them to silence critics.
The new legislation comes after several high profile cases involving arrests and detention without charge during periods of unrest last year. A number of prominent figures—including activist Louay Makhlouf and former Prime Minister Hani Al Asfari—are currently being held pending trial at various locations across the country. Others remain imprisoned with no clear date set when they may finally face justice.
In response to criticism from international groups about its crackdowns, authorities acknowledged some shortcomings but defended the reforms saying they would help maintain public order. However, many observers believe this latest move

$1 = "david" + "$2"+ "#3"
print (list)

 david ($1) david ($2)

This print statement returns a list with n elements where each element represents one entity from the given set of entities. The order of return for this function depends on whether it's called before or after the matching clause. If you call it immediately following the matching clause then its value should reflect that; otherwise if there are more than two matches then they'll have been processed by now. This can also help identify which part of the sentence was being evaluated at any point during processing.

The second argument to this method takes precedence over the first when calling it because it sets up the environment variable used to store the result. It defaults to true but could easily change depending on what type of data structure your program uses. For instance, if you're storing values into a string-like buffer then setting it to false would make sense since strings don't support nesting while still allowing them to hold multiple items without breaking down. However, if you use pointers instead then setting it to 0 won't matter much either way so long as both arguments agree about how many characters per line their contents must contain. In such cases, we recommend
