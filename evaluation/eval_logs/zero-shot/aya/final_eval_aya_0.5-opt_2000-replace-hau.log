Question: What region is Anambra State in Nigeria?
Answer: Arewa (A)
Anambra state is made out of three separate states - Awka North Local Government Area, Nnewi South LGA and Aguata Municipal Council Areas.

aincently, here's what I think about this topic. It seems like there are two parts to it; one part says "what is Anambara?" while another part says "where does Anambra take place." There isn't really any logical connection between these statements so they could be considered as different questions or even answers depending how much information we have at hand.

Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia. The call was made through various Iranian media outlets including PressTV, Farsnews Agency (FNA) and IRNA news agency. It is worth noting that Iran has been providing assistance for Somali since 2001 when it started its first food distribution program under President Hassan Rohani. However, this time around there are more than half million starving children across Somalia who need help from international donors as well as local governments like those run by Mogadishu. As such, we urge our fellow citizens living outside Somalia not to postpone their donations until they can be assured about receiving them before leaving Somalia or else risk being turned away at ports of entry into Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan and others where visas may take months if not years to obtain. We also ask that individuals consider contributing directly instead of indirectly so that funds aren't spent unnecessarily. A donation will go towards feeding these innocent children while ensuring no one goes without nutritious meal due to lack of money.����������������EDOCTORIANS TO ALL INTERNATIONAL DONORS: I'm very happy to announce that my government received $500,000 today! Thank God
