Does this Amharic statement; "obodo à wu igwe" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only  indicate the positive/negative sentiment of the word.

What is the correct answer to this question: 'Obodo' has an Neutral sentiment and 'a-wunye' has a negative sentiment.

 Answer : Obodo = Neutral
 Explanation : The neutral sentiment in 'obe', which means that it does not matter what happens next (i.e., no one can decide), reflects positively on the situation as long as nothing bad comes out of it. This indicates that things will be fine even if there are problems ahead. However, when something good turns up from behind, then we say that everything turned around for us was better than expected. So, while both phrases convey the same message about how life goes round, they use different words with slightly opposite meanings.        		--	---	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--	--

Question: When was Amaechi Muonagor born?
Answer: She was born on August 25 1991.
Amaechi's father died when she was eight years old. Her mother raised her siblings after their dad left them behind. She went through secondary school before moving into acting.
She made her film debut at age 16 playing Mary Nwankwara alongside Omotola Jalade Ejiofor. 
Her performance received critical acclaim from critics alike who hailed it for its emotional impact. ome Entertainment called her 'one of Africa’s most promising young actresses'.

The news that will interest you: The government of India has decided not to go for a referendum on whether or not it should hold elections in 2014, as was planned earlier this year by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his party partners at the Centre. This is seen as an attempt to delay democracy's inevitable transition from one-man rule under Indira Gandhi (who led the country into its first democratic era) towards direct presidential control over all aspects of governance. It follows that there are no grounds now available either legally or constitutionally for holding such polls before 2015 when Modi becomes President following the demise of Mrs Sonia Gandhi who had been serving her second term since 2004. However, even if they were held after then, with conditions imposed like those envisaged above, none would be able to win enough seats to form a majority Government without having support from other parties besides BJP which holds 80 out of 543 parliamentary constituencies across the length and breadth of Indian subcontinent. In addition, given the current political situation where Congress appears set to return to power through some sort of coalition arrangement, including possibly involving regional players like Jharkhandi Prakashan Party, Chhattisgarhi Janata Dal and others, we can expect further delays beyond what already exists. There have also been reports about how senior leaders
