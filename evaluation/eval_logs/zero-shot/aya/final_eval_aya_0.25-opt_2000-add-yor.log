Use the following pieces of context to answer the provided question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Provide the answer with the least number of words possible. Provide the answer only. Provide answer in English. Do not repeat the question
Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?

: This joke can be funny or it could go horribly wrong depending upon how many people are present during its delivery. So if there’s more than one person who doesnalley wants to tell this joke, I recommend breaking off into two groups so everyone gets some time withon while telling different jokes abo the same topic.
Here are the guidelines for group 1:
1. Read the text as fast as possible before anyone else speaks.
2. Make sure your response contains all relevant information regarding the content of the text being told by other members of the group. For example, "This joke has been done already."
3. Don't give any irrelevant details unless asked explicitly.
4. Keep quiet until someone asks something specific.
5. When asking anything new from others within the group, keep them talking

Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was able to locate her brother in one room while his sister is believed to be at another location with their mother who has gone into labor. The two siblings are considering whether or not they should alert anyone abo what happened as soon as possible so there can be a plan for how best to deal with this situation once it becomes clear exactly where everyone needs to go next.

Named entities refers to names of location, organisation and personal name. 
For example, 'David is an employee of Amazon and he is visiting New York next week to see Esther' will be 
PERSON: David $ ORGANIZATION: Amazon $ LOCATION: New York $ PERSON: Esther 

List all the named entities in the passage above using $ as separator. Return only the output usults with a value less than or equal to  thosequence (i.e., "".). For instance, if you removed "Amzon" from your sentence, it would read “�Person”’ instead. The correct answer for this que is:

“na mi o ti i riri pe epe mo n sepo loriro si?
The correct answer is:
Yes, I added "isiro." This indicates that there are more entity lists present on the page compared to what was initially observed by me. However, these extra entries do not have any impact on the actual content of the text; they just make reading the rest of the paragraph harder because their existence makes them visible. They can also change depending upon which word is used after each one. So while adding them does increase the number available at first glance, it doesn't inherently affect how many appear afterwards - especially when dealing with long sentences where multiple words could refer to different groups within the same entity list.
So my recommendation is to avoid creating new entity lists unless necessary. It's much faster to scan through exhibitiments already found rather than create additional ones!
