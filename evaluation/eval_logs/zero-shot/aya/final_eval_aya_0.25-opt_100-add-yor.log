Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977.

Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she saw two men in a white van with red lights on it coming out of her friend's house at around 1:30am. The video shows one man opening his door while another pulls up alongside him as soon as he gets into the vehicle. After entering their car, they drove off without any further interaction between them or anyone else present. According to TMZ, prosecutors argue that these activities are suspicious because there was no visible traffic jam leading up to this point nor were other vehicles passing by when all three cars arrived within minutes after each other. They also argued that since the victims' phones weren’s location is unknown (it could have been anywhere), how did they locate each other? Additionally, prosecutors believe that the presence of surveillance cameras inside the neighborhood makes it likely that someone recorded what happened prior to the actual hit-and-run event. This evidence will be used against Díaz for attempted murder if found during trial.

Named entities refers to names of location, organisation and personal name. 
For example, 'David is an employee of Amazon and he is visiting New York next week to see Esther' will be 
PERSON: David $ ORGANIZATION: Amazon $ LOCATION: New York $ PERSON: Esther 

List all the named entities in the passage above using $ as separator. Return only the output 

$ (1) David (2) Esther (3)

The answer for each entity can then be summarized by adding or subtracting numbers from both sides of a negative number. For instance, if we add 2+5=10, it means that David has added 5% more time on his work schedule compared with what was planned before he came into contact with Esther. This indicates that he did not meet his original objectives but instead spent some extra hours working towards them despite being under pressure due to her strong objection against him doing this earlier.
