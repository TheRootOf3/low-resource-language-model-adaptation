Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia. The government has been unable to provide assistance due to lack of funds as well as international sanctions against it for its alleged involvement with terrorism. Millions have died from hunger or disease since then.
"The situation is getting out of control," sai Habib Abubakr Mohamed Ali, who runs an orphanage center near Mogadishu. "We are not receiving any food at this time." He added that his staff had gone without paychecks for months because they were working under heavy debt burdenss caused by their efforts to help those affected by the famine.
In response to the call made last week, President Hassan Rohani directed Iranian Red Crescent Organization (IRCO) members across Iran to donate money towards providing relief goods such as grain, water bottles, blankets, mosquito nets, medicine, clothing, etc., according to IRCON officials. They also called upon local mosques to hold fundraising campaigns during Friday prayers.
A spokesperson for IRONEX told VOA Persian that some 80 percent of donations received so far go directly into disaster management projects like distributing emergency supplies to victims. However, he noted there was still room for more support: "There needs to be greater cooperation between different agencies within our country [in addressing] these crises."
