Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?
Answer: He was 23 yearsold. the above statement, it will be observed from the given hint that the previous question asked about how long did they get pregnant together before getting married again. This indicates that their wedding date could have been as early as 1972 or 1974. However, there are several reasons why this might have taken place after 1973 such as;
- They were already engaged by then. For example, if one has two months left until her due date, she can still conceive during that time even though she hasn’s now 32 weeks gone into labor. Sooner rather than later would mean either earlier or more frequent unprotected sex prior to marriage.
- She got pregnant much faster than planned because of certain hormones being released within days of ovulation. Many women find out whether they're expecting babies through vaginal examinations but many do so without knowing what type of test results they'll receive. In other cases, some people may think that pregnancy doesn't start happening right away since morning sickness isn't really recognized yet. When I had my second child seven years ago, nobody knew that I'd become pregnant despite having lost five kilograms while trying forever to shed all those extra pounds!
Sooner instead of Later implies that the person who answered yes/no didn't

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. According to her account, they found a small bag with numerous fetish items inside along with two passports tied up in an orange cloth that contained no information about them except for their names. The passport was opened by one person who then disappeared into the night while his companion continued searching through the trash can where he kept it. After several hours without any progress on this investigation, police announced that there were indeed human remains discovered at the site but couldn’sad news is that none had been identified yet as all efforts are continuing towards identifying the victims. epa:
