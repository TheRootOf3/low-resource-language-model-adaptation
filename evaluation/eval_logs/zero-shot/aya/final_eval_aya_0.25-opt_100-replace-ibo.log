Does this Amharic statement; "obodo à wu igwe" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only  indicate the positive/negative nature of their answer.

Nkebi: Yes (1) Nnebe: No (2) Neutral: Indifferent: Uninterested: Disagree: Agree: Oppose: Abstain: Not Applicable: Can't Say: Don't Know: I'm not sure: It's hard to say: There are several possible interpretations for this word. The most common interpretation is that it means 'unlikely', but there could be other meanings as well. For example, in some contexts, an unimpressive response might mean they're neutral about something and can't decide on what side they'll fall into. In another context, someone who doesn't know much may just state that they don't really care either way because nobody knows anything yet anyway. This expression also has various connotations depending on how you use it - e.g., if used with respect towards people from different ethnic groups, then it suggests openness-mindedness while being negative when applied against individuals within your own group. So far so good! However, since we haven't given any examples here, let us now give one more...

The news that will interest you:  A boy was arrested in a village for stealing money from his father's house, and he is now being tried by an official court of law. The case has been brought before several judges who have decided on different sentences based on their own interpretations of laws concerning theft. However, one judge said it would be better if this child were given life imprisonment because there are many cases where children commit crimes against society but they get off with light punishment due to lack of evidence or witnesses. This particular man also told me about another incident involving two men whom I saw standing behind him during my trip here today. One day these same individuals came into our hotel lobby while we were having dinner together at around 7 p.m., as soon as they entered the building, one of them started screaming loudly like some sort of animal which frightened everyone present inside the restaurant. He then ran out of the place without paying any attention towards anyone else within sight. When asked what happened after all those people left, he replied something along the lines of "I just went back home." It seems that whenever someone comes across such incidents, they always end up getting beaten down by other members of society even though they may not do anything wrong themselves. So when discussing how things should go forth nowadays, I believe it
