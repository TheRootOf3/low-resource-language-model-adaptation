Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia. The government has been unable to provide assistance due to lack of funds as well as political turmoil within Somali itself. However, it is still possible for Iranian NGOss or individuals with money available to help those affected by this natural disaster.: "All Iranians are called upon to assist their fellow countrymen who have fallen into poverty.": "The situation in Somalia needs our immediate attention because there seems no hope at present," sai Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, leader of Iran from 1989 until his death in 2005. He was buried alongside other prominent figures like Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1924–1982) and Imam Hussein Fadlul Islami (1896–1976). While not directly addressing current events related to Somalia specifically, President Hassan Rohani congratulated the nation on its achievements during the previous year while also acknowledging that more work must be done towards economic stability and development.: “We will continue working hard so we can move closer to our goals”�: "This message comes after observing an increase in violence against innocent members of society such as children, women, journalists, etc., which I condemn unreservedly," he added.: 'I'm sorry but my time isn't up yet,' she told reporters before leaving Tehran
