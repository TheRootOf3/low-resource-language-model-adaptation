Question: When was Amaechi Muonagor born?
Answer: She was born on August 25 1991.
Amaechi's father died when she was young leaving her mother to raise three children; Monica, Charity and Josephine. Her siblings were all given different names which led them into various careers like Monica became a singer while Charity worked at a bank before moving out for good after marriage. Josephine went back to school but never completed it because of family pressure. Charity stayed behind where she grew up until she left Lagos State University to study criminology. She returned from London two years ago to complete her studies. She now works part time alongside her husband who also holds down another job. Their daughter Monica is currently engaged to be married off this year. The couple have been together almost eight months already.
Her brother Charity had gone through some personal issues during their childhood leading to his death due to alcoholism. His wife Monica decided to take care of things herself so they could focus more on work rather than living under the shadow of her dead sibling. This decision resulted in her becoming a successful actress. She starred in several films including "Mana Nkere", "Biko na Basket", "N'eziri Nwata" and "Ozugbo" among many other titles. She recently released her debut album

Question: Kedụ mgbe a mụrụ Amaechi Muonagor?
Answer: The correct response is 2Rats!
Chukwu's second film after 1Rats!, titled 2Rats!, features some of Africa's most celebrated stars including Omotola Jalade Eko, Joseph Akpothah Williams, Adejoke Aniamaka, Yomi Azikiwe, Charity Nwankwo, Kenan Elumelu, Bimbo Okoyom, among many other notable names from across the continent. It also marks the return of veteran filmmaker Sir Warrior Smith who had been out of filmmaking for over two decades before making another comeback under Chukwu's leadership.
The story follows a young woman named Monica (played by Charity Wankwo), whose life gets turned upside down when she meets her long lost father at a barbershop where they both work together. She then starts having dreams about being part of this secret society called 'the rats', which are led by enigmatic leader Dr. Tunde Idowu (Omotola Jaladewere). This group aims to bring back ancient African traditions like magic rituals, healing ceremonies, etc., while maintaining their own unique way of living. They use various methods to achieve these goals but it seems things aren’t going well until Monica realizes there might be more

The news that will interest you: The government of Ethiopia has issued a statement condemning Israel's use of force in Gaza and calling for an end to all acts against civilians, including airstrikes by Israeli forces on Palestinian civilian areas. It also called upon both sides "to exercise maximum restraint" during this time period. This is significant because it represents another diplomatic victory over Israel after its brutal offensive last week. However, there are still many questions about what happened at al-Shati refugee camp near Beersheba where several hundred Palestinians were arrested following Friday prayers as part of Operation Protective Edge (the military operation). Many have been wounded or killed while trying to flee from Hamas rocket fire into Tel Aviv. There was no immediate comment made by either side regarding these allegations but they may be related to ongoing negotiations between Egypt and Qatar concerning Egyptian sovereignty claims along their maritime border with Yemen. In addition, reports indicate that some Israelis who had fled from Gaza returned home due to concerns about possible retaliation attacks should they return. These developments could add further pressure onto already tense relations among neighbors. On Sunday evening, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed his countrymen via video conference before going off to meet President Obama at Camp David. He said he would discuss matters relating to Jerusalem, security measures taken since the start of hostilities, and other issues when he returns
