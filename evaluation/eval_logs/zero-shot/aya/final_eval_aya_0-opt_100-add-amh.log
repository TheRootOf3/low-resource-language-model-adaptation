Translate the English sentence below to Amharic. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today. The amendments include a ban on "hurling insults" at journalists, as well as an amendment that prohibits any publication of libelous statements about individuals or groups without their permission. They also prohibit defamation against public figures who have been formally charged with wrongdoing. These changes are part of legislation introduced last year following protests over media coverage of demonstrations during King Abdullah's visit to Egypt. Protesters accused government officials of using excessive force when they tried to quell unrest after his arrival from Cairo. In response, authorities issued arrest warrants for several prominent activists including former president Omar Suleiman, whom protesters accuse of being involved in violence while he was still serving under Mubarak. Earlier this month, prosecutors filed charges against him alongside other high-profile dissidents like Mohamed ElBaradei and Ahmed Shafiq. Under Jordanian laws dating back more than two centuries, it is illegal to insult anyone publicly unless one has first obtained written consent from them. This clause allows people to express themselves freely but does not protect those making defamatory comments about others anonymously. However, some argue that these clauses do little to safeguard freedom of speech because many cases involving anonymous criticism go unpunished due to poor evidence. A new section added to the penal code states: "Whoever hurles insults shall be liable to punishment."
