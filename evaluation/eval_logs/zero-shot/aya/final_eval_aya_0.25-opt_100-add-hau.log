Question: What region is Anambra State in Nigeria?
Answer: It's within the South-East Region of Nigeria.URAL SUMMARY OF THE STATE'S INFLUENCE OVER A CIVILIZATION AREA :
Anambra State has been known as Bendel Insurance Company Limited since its establishment in 1879. This company later became part of United African Life Assurance Co., which merged into Union General Insurance Plc (now UBA) in 1958.

Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia. The government has been unable to provide assistance due to lack of funds as well as political turmoil within its own country. Millions have died from hunger or disease since then. "The situation is very serious," sai Ayatollah Ali Khomeini, who was Iran's president at the time. He called for international help: "We are begging everyone with money; we need it." The Islamic Republic of Iran sends food parcels through diplomatic channels but says they will not be enough until there is more funding available. A spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) told IRNA that some 80% of Somali children under five were now stunted by malnutrition. She added that an estimated 1 million Somalis had fled their homes because of conflict between different groups over land resources. 'I'm Not Sure I Can Do It' In response to the call made last week, President Hassan Rohani promised $100m (£60mn). However he acknowledged this would take months before any assistance could reach those affected. Mr Rohania also noted his administration faced challenges beyond financial ones such as fighting terrorism and economic hardship among other issues. "This issue isn't just about providing relief goods," he stated during a meeting hosted by the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month. "It

(Amhara: "sannawa ne kadai ba mu yi shida amma")

 Amsha: "sarannawar" is an adverbial word that describes something as being like or resembling it in some way and has no meanin other than its usage by someone else who knows what they are talking about. It's used often when describing things such as animals, insects, people, etc., but also for noun words which have similarities with another thing without any real relationship between them beyond their common name. For example, if I were discussing my favorite food at dinner one night while sitting beside my friend, she might point out how much better her steak tasted compared to mine; this would be called “�shen-na’”�gida”� ”�e nufari””’. In contrast, if we talked about our mutual love interest, then it wouldn’�t really fair to compare apples to oranges because there isn’�t anything physically similar about us except for our names! So, even though many different cultures use these same adjectives, each language uses them differently depending on where it comes from.
