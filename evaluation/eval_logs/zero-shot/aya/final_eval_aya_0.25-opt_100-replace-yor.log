Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was able to locate her mother in one room while watching TV with siblings Diego and Gerardo; they were crying uncontrollably when their father came back into the house minutes later. The two children then went downstairs immediately after seeing him enter. They saw his bloodied shirt lying on a table inside the kitchen as he sat down at the dining area. He had been shot several times already but still managed to eat some food before collapsing onto the couch. After receiving first aid for about an hour until paramedics arrived, he died shortly thereafter despite intensive care by doctors.
