Does this Amharic statement; "obodo à wu igwe" have a {{Neutral, Positive or Negative}} sentiment? Labels only  indicate the positive/negative nature of the word.

What is the correct answer to this question: What does 'obe' mean in Amhara (a language spoken by Ethiopia) and what are its different meanings? The correct answer lies within the category labeled Neutral. It means that it can be used as either an adjective for something else like 'noble', 'good-looking', etc., or even negative when referring to someone's character. This usage was introduced into English grammar during the 17th century with the use of neutral adjectives such as 'unfortunate'. However, some argue that these words should not exist because they do not describe anything about people but rather their surroundings.

The news that will interest you: The government of Ethiopia has issued a decree which allows for the removal from office and prosecution of all officials who have been involved in corruption during their time as ministers or members of parliament, including those serving under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed since he took power last year. This is part of an ongoing crackdown on political interference by Ethiopian authorities following months-long protests over economic hardship and human rights abuses committed against civilians at home and abroad. On April 25th this week, police arrested several senior figures within the ruling coalition after they were found with large sums of money hidden inside homes across Addis Abeba. These include former Finance Minister Selassie Tadesse; his deputy, Berhanu Nega; and two other lawmakers—Hilal Gebremichael and Zerema Tekede. They are being held pending trial before a special tribunal set up specifically to try cases related to alleged graft involving public servants. In addition, prosecutors also raided offices belonging to some prominent businessmen whom they suspect may be linked to corrupt practices. Many more arrests could follow soon. Officials said these raids would continue until there was "complete compliance" among politicians about preventing future misconducts. However, many analysts believe such measures amount to little more than symbolic gestures intended to signal displeasure but not necessarily punishment.
