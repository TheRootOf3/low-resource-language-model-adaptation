Use the following pieces of context to answer the provided question. If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer. Provide the answer with the least number of words possible. Provide the answer only. Provide answer in English. Do not repeat the question
Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977.

Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: Ọmọ ọdun melo ni Cosmas Maduka nigbati o fẹ iyawo rẹ Charity?

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was watching TV when her husband came downstairs with a friend who had come over for dinner. Her son went into their room while his mother watched TV. During this time, he asked them about him going out on Saturday night without saying anything else. After telling him they were just having some drinks at the bar in town, he left again. When he got back minutes later, he appeared drunk as usual. He then disappeared inside the house. The two women started looking everywhere but couldn’t find any sign of him or anyone else being present during those hours. They decided it would be best if they stayed there until morning because they weren't sure what could have happened after all these years. So they trudged through the woods behind their property till dawn. In the end, no one was found dead nor did anyone recognize the person seen walking away from the gatekeeper post earlier that day. 
A brief overview of how the case has been covered by local media:

 On April 19th, 2018, reporters began spreading around an article written seven months ago regarding the disappearance of Josefina "Luz" María Díaz-Mejia (née Cruz) which contained numerous details suggesting that something might have gone wrong between the

What does this tell us about the content of the sentence? It suggests a person or entity mentions "is" before "se". The word "ise" indicates possession whereas ejo means being able to do something; therefore, if you are referring to someone who can make things happen, then they mention their ability to make them appear on time for work when mentioned prior to mentioning anything else related to what could infer from the previous statement. This makes sense because individuals often use words such as “�to’ instead of ‘their”� which refer to physical actions rather than mental states. For instance, we might say, “My dog ate my homework yesterday! To prevent further issues with him/her I am going to buy some food today at Walmart”� while still stating our intention by adding the phrase “�and also...’ after each action described earlier. In addition, people frequently add prepositions between clauses indicating ownership over items associated with another individual or group. So, for example, ‘If Mary loves apples she should definitely eat one right now’ implies Mary knows how to enjoy apples but
