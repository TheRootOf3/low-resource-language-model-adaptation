Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today. The amendments, which will be signed into effect on Monday, are aimed at curbing freedom of speech through a new regulation that requires all news websites operating under Jordanian jurisdiction (including those based abroad) to register with authorities before publishing any content or information deemed "offensive" against state institutions such as government officials, religious figures etc..The legislation also stipulates fines for violations ranging from $1 million up to 10% of annual revenue if found guilty; however it is unclear how these penalties would apply when applied retrospectively since no one has yet been charged over this issue so far.In addition there have already been several cases where journalists who had published articles critical towards certain individuals within the ruling elite including King Abdullah II's son Prince Hamzah bin Hussein Al Saud was arrested last year after he posted an article about his father being involved in corruption scandals involving public funds while serving as governor general of Saudi Arabia during 2011-2012."This bill represents another attempt by the regime to silence dissent," said Omar al Haddad, director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East division.
