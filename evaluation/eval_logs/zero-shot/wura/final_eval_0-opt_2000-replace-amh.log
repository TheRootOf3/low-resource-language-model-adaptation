Translate the English sentence below to Amharic. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today. The legislation prohibits any media source from publishing content that is considered "false or misleading" on a subject of public importance, such as politics, religion, human rights issues etc.. It also requires all websites with more than 1 million page view per month (which includes blogs) to obtain prior approval for their articles before posting them anywhere else including Facebook pages which are not permitted under this new legislation either. This means bloggers who have been blogging since 2005 will be forced into embracing censorship if they want to continue doing so without having to seek permission first every time an article appears elsewhere - even though it's technically true there isn’�t anything wrong about what I'm saying here because my blog has over 2 million views monthly but unfortunately many other people use our services everyday like twitter where we can reach millions easily through wordpress platforms... Which makes me wonder how much pressure these guys put on themselves when producing news stories? Do journalists actually check out each story beforehand just to make sure its accurate? Or do editors take things at face value regardless whether facts support those conclusions? What happens next once everyone begins complaining about being restricted from using certain sources due to government interference : Will everybody start demanding access to information via different channels instead of expecting everything published somewhere to follow the same rules set forth by governments worldwide
