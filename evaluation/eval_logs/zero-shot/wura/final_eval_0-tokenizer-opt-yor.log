[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was told by her daughter who lives in Mexico City: "I have no idea what is happening."
Diaz says he has been deported back across the border into Guatemala but remains confident his family will be found alive somewhere along their journey through Central America as they continue on with this search for him. He hopes someone out there can help them find him before it becomes too late because according to police reports, he hasn’t shown up at work since last Friday afternoon when a report came down saying that one of his employees had seen him walking around outside of his house without shoes or shirt after returning early from lunch break. They also noted that he never showed any signs of stress nor depression during interviews conducted over several days prior to his disappearance which means something must still happen between now and Thursday night where another meeting takes place involving all local authorities including immigration officials. This isn‘s why everyone involved wants people not just looking for missing persons alone anymore—they need more hands-on efforts such like these two women doing everything possible within minutes while staying calm under pressure until they get results instead of relying solely off information provided by friends/family about anyone being suspicious. It really does show how important good communication skills are especially among families trying desperately to keep tabs on
