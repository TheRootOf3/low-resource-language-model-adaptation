Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?

Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?
Answer: He met her while working as a clerk in one of their father’� s stores where she worked part-time after school hours because they were poor students who had no money or education but wanted to be able to support themselves by selling clothes from home. They got engaged two years later during a trip abroad together; it took them six months before they could get back due to bad weather conditingly caused by Cyclone Yala. After marriage, they lived in Lagos State until 1985 when they moved into Oke Aro Estate Ikoyi, Ibadannaa Islalomuwa Road, Ikeja, ln 1987. In 1988, they opened their own store ca ‘ “�The Car Store” ” near Lekki Phase 1 Shopping Mall. Their son, Chukwuma Maduka became interested in cars so much though there wasn t any car dealer around then. So, he decided to buy some used vehicles himself using borrowed funds. This led to the birth of the second generation of the family owning several dealerships across the country including the largest dealership chain known today under the brand names of Kia Motors Ltd., Toyota Cars Limitedd & Services Ltd..and Honda Vehicles Lilleodges etc.

Answer: I think it would be difficult because they were both very young people who had been together since childhood so there wasn’�t much time between them but as far back then we knew each other well enough where one could tell if another person liked or disliked someone by looing into their eyes; this made us feel comfortable around eachother even though our relationship didn´t last long after marriage. We lived closeby from day 1 till date of death,so i guess she must have felt like family too..

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was in her bedroom when a man entered through an open window at around 11:30 p.m., armed with what appeared like a gun or shotgun. The woman told police he pointed it toward her face before taking off running down the street towards his car parked outside their house on West 4th Street near North Avenue. Police cordoned off part of the block as they tried to locate him but were unable to find anyone who matched the suspect’�s description; however, officers did recover two guns inside the residence where both men lived—one loaded.38 caliber pistol found by one officer while another recovered a 9mm semi-automatic weapon during a search later returned empty after being fired into the ground several times.[1][2]. A second person living nearby also saw someone enter via an unlocked front door sometime between 10pm–11am (the time of the shooting) which is consistent with eyewitness accounts [3], although no arrests have been made yet for this incident either way.
