Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?

Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?
Answer: He had been born as Charles Emmanuel Okechukwu Enoch Adegoke on April 1st 1954; however, it has since become common knowledge among Nigerians that this man’�s real birth date would be March 31st 1955 because there are no records available showing any other year or month where such information could have come from. According to some sources, Mr. Enoch Adekunle Ogunwusi-Madukah(Cosmos), who died aged 82 years last week Thursday May 14th 2020, may well still exist but we will never find out about it until after death due to lack of evidence proving otherwise. This means that if someone were so determined they can dig deep enough into history books without finding anything else then one should believe them even though their claim might seem implausible, especially considering how many people die every day before being discovered by historians/archaeologists etc.. It must therefore be noted here that all these claims made above regarding the existence of Mr. Egunmola Ogunuwaaremadaka(Cosmo). His actual birthday remains unknown till now!

Answer: I am sure it will be difficult because there are many people who have been named Charity but they all look alike! It would help if we had some pictures or videos so as to identify them more accurately...

[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was in her bedroom when a man entered through an open window at around 1:30am on Sunday morning (March 8). He then forced his way into her room where he allegedly raped her before fleeing with $1,000 worth of jewelry. The woman told police that after assaulting her, the suspect fled back out onto the street via another door leading off their apartment building. According to reports by local news outlets such as El Nuevo Herald, investigators are still trying to determine whether this is just one incident or if there have been other similar attacks against women living near the intersection between Avenida de Mayo y Avanzada del Carmen.
