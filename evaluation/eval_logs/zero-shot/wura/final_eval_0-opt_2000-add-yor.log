[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she had seen her son with his head in a bag on top of another man who was tied up by other men at their residence near Coluombia Avenue and South Street around 10:30 p.m., but he denied knowing anyone named "Raul" or having any ties to him. He also told police officers that they were not aware that anybody else lived there except for them two people. They added that neither one nor both knew anything about what happened after this incident occurred because nobody came out when asked if something needed help during these hours before dawn yesterday morning. This report is based solely upon information provided by Ms. Reyes; it may be different than others available online due to its brevity.
