Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.
Question: How old was Cosmas Maduka when he married his wife, Charity?
Answer: He had been born August 1st 1939 as Cosmas Oluwasegun Adebayo Obinrinla-Madukatunde. His father died before he could be raised by his mother who later remarried. As such, it would have taken some time until she got her husband’s inheritance from their late parents. It took another two years after this marriage till they were able to start living together without any financial constraints or problems because both parties worked hard towards making things happen. They eventually became successful entrepreneurs through various means including selling cars under different brands like Naijiria Motors Limited, Jomo Motors Nigeria Ltd., etc.. In fact, one year into their relationship, Madaka bought himself a car worth about $1 000 dollars! This money helped them buy more vehicles but unfortunately, due to lack of funds, they couldn”�t afford all these expensive purchases so instead of buying new ones each month, they used what little cash they saved every week to pay off debts incurred during previous months. Their children grew older while still being supported financially since there wasn‘t enough income coming out of the family farm where most members are farmers. After several attempts over many decades, Maduakaladunmola finally succeeded in

She said that she was in her bedroom when a man knocked on her door at around 11:30 p.m., saying he had been robbed by two men who were armed with guns outside their house near Barangay San Pablo. The thieves took off with an undisclosed amount of money they reportedly left behind inside his bag as well as some clothes. Police officers arrived shortly after but did not find any suspects or evidence linking them up to this robbery incident yet.
