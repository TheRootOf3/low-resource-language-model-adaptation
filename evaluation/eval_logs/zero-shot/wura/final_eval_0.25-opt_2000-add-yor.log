[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she had been told by her mother-in-law who was in a room with them when they were arrested: "They took me out because I am pregnant." The couple is due for their first child on August 19th; according to reports, it will be born at 6 p.m., which would make this an early birthday celebration!
