Amendments to the press and publications law restricting online expression in Jordan were passed by parliament today. The new laws, which came into force on Monday, ban any form of "false or misleading information" that could mislead people about a government policy such as an economic reform package.The draft was approved with 91 votes for it out of 153 members voting at the House of Representatives meeting last week. It has been criticized because they are not clear enough but critics have said there is no alternative way forward without further clarification."We need more time," one member told reporters after the vote. Others noted how difficult it would be to amend them since many journalists work from home due to Covid-19 restrictions.Some opposition parties called for boycotting Parliament's plenary session scheduled next Tuesday over what they described as unfair treatment towards their party leaders who abstained during Sunday night’s debate while three others did so quietly behind closed doors.Opposition MPs also boycotted the first day of parliamentary business this year when Prime Minister Omar al Sissi opened his speech saying he had received numerous requests regarding various issues including the current health crisis caused by coronavirus pandemic. He added: “I am convinced we will overcome these challenges together".
