[Update] As members of SEBIN searched Diaz's and Soto's home, Luz Mely Reyes reported live from the scene. She said that she was in her bedroom when a man knocked on it at around 11:30 p.m., asking for help with his wife who had been shot by an unknown person inside their house near Avenida Libertad Ave. The woman told him he needed medical attention immediately but instead went back into hiding as gunshots rang out outside. Her husband then called police after hearing shots fired again about 15 minutes later while they were still tryingna get away. Police arrived within two hours and found both women dead along with three bullets holes through one wall where someone must have entered via another door or window because there is no other way this could happen without being seen," wrote Maribel Rodriguez-Cisneros. "The deceased are identified as Maria Teresa Ramirez (52), mother of five; Jose Antonio Sanchez Flores Jr.(48) father of six children including four boys aged between 12 years old and 16 months old." According to reports, the shooter fled before officers got here so now investigators will be looking closely at all possible leads.
