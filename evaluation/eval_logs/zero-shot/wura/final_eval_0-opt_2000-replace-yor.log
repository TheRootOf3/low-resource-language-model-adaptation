Context: The startup also failed sooner than expected and Maduka went on to found Coscharis Motor with the sum of three hundred nairas (N300) which focused on sales of automobile spare parts in 1977. The name of the company according to him is a combination of his first name, Cosmos, and his wife, Charity, whom he married at age 21. Maduka's business breakthrough started in 1982 when the Nigerian government granted ten (10) motor companies import licenses, for which Coscharis was selected.

Answer: I am confident this will be correct as it relates to the above-given scenario; however, there are other options available depending upon how much detail we need from your response. For example, if you want us to look into some more specific details about the circumstances leading up to Maduka’s marriage or perhaps even whether she had any financial support during their relationship—that would help narrow down our search results further.​—
