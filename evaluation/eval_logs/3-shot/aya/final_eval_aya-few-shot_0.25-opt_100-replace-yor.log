Contextual Sentiments are used in pairs with other words and they express various emotions such as happiness (or sadness), anger, fear, etc.. The word "yáàra" indicates that something bad has happened while the rest of the sentence expresses feelings towards it. 
Examples 1 : I have just come from visiting my parents who live peacefully at their home since many years ago when there was no problem between us two. But recently things turned sour again after some unexpected events took place within our family which led me back to this house where everything seems like yesterday's memories now.
Question 2 : How do you describe your current predicament? Do you feel defeated? Are you very happy about what could be ahead for you? Did you see any light on the horizon regarding future opportunities?

 by an event occurred within our family last year leading to several upsets within our household. This incident brought out different side effects upon myself and others around me whom were also affected by these changes but we all came through them without much issue except for minor pain here and there due to certain health problems caused during the time involved. However, everyone got over those obstacles soon enough and started living happily everafter once more despite being apart from each other because of reasons beyond

Others view such rituals not only symbolically but practically; believing that when individuals place heavy rocks under vehicles, bad spirits will travel over the vehicle instead of being trapped beneath its wheels. This belief has led some communities to build large ceremonial centers dedicated entirely to stoning perceived enemies—including children accused of witchcraft. of the stone cairs include death, dishonesty, jealousy, hatred, ignorance, disobedience, fearfulness, penury, lack of employment, legal troubles, etc.; all considered detrimental aspects of life. of the stone cairs includes

Translation: This morning at around 6am (CST), three men arrived in front of the house where reporter and human rights activist Dr. Lucy Liu resides with her family. After seeing them enter through an unlocked door, she screamed for help immediately hitting one man who then fired his pistol towards their faces as they tried to flee into another room. During that brief struggle, two other people were hit by bullet holes but did not sustain any injuries despite being struck several times.

Question: Where is my husband? My son? Why are you shooting me right now! I'm innocent; it was just a matter of words between us. You're wicked; why do you want to kill him so badly? Don't touch me again or else there will be blood all over your hands like what happened before when we went out yesterday night. Now get away from here while you still can because if something happens to either of us, don't even think about coming back until further notice. Do whatever you have to do; no more talking unless otherwise stated. And last thing—don't dare try anything funny again. It won’t go well for you.”
