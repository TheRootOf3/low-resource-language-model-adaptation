Text: When I came into this world, my mother told me that she had been pregnant seven months prior to birth. During her pregnancy, she put all of her eggs inside one basket while covering them up so no other person would find out about their location or how many there were. She then took care of those babies during infancy without ever telling anyone else who they really belonged to because if people knew where these little ones were coming from, everyone could have taken advantage of them financially. So after spending nine years living peacefully within our family home—that’�s exactly why we don't talk much about it now!—I decided to take another look around and see whether any more information might be available regarding my parents' history before leaving here behind. After some research, I identified several possible locations based upon historical events mentioned above but couldn‘t seem able to locate anything further specific beyond "My Grand Father" being involved in an earlier incident involving a stolen egg. As such, despite having done everything right except getting myself lost along the roadside, I am still unable to gain access to the truth about my past life nor do I believe that wherever I seek answers lies ahead. With that said, let us go back to bed again... 😉

Question: How does one define "a brief" in relation to the previous statement? Sure it is shorter but what about when you are talking about an entire paragraph or even more than that? I have tried using various word embedding systems like Word Embeddings for my articles on other platforms such as WordPress and Blogger but they do not seem very user friendly compared with Excel which has been around forever so there must be something else out there right now!

Translation: In order for us to locate him we will be searching his house as soon as possible. 

Question: How do you know that he is really gone?  Answer: With all due respect I can't say anything more about it because there are still questions regarding who exactly was present in the area at the moment when the shooting happened.
Question: Who were they looking for then?  Answer: It doesn't matter if anyone knows or not; what matters here is whether any one has seen them with their hands on the trigger during the shooting itself.
Question: So how did you find out where he went after the shooting?         Explanation: We found an abandoned building nearby so we used our night vision goggless to see inside and saw that he had already left by himself before dawn.
Question: Where does your husband work these days?  Explanation: He works around the clock now but prior to that he worked late hours every day until recently whenever he felt like doing something extra instead of going back to bed afterwards.
Question: What kind of car does he drive?     Explanation: A black Nissan Versailles.
Question: Do you have children yourself?  Explanation: No, my son lives overseas right now while mine isn't
