Sentiments: A to B and C are considered as same sentences in English language. However, sentence (D) is not grammatically correct because it does not contain any words other than "tallafin" or "nigeria". It could be replaced by "tallafabba." The choice of ending clause depends on whether you wan to convey an idea that's more complex or less simple compared with what was conveyed before. For example, if your message says "Nigerian women have been known for their beauty," then end phrase should be "koyi wa na biyari ne", which means 'beauty' but also has another meanin like 'fancy'. If instead, your message states something about how Nigerians can't take care of themselves, then use "bayan nan da suke yiwa kuka ga ciki cewarsu."

Context: Egypt has been under British rule since 1922; it gained independence in 1952 after having negotiated several periods of Egyptian sovereignty over time. However, there have always been questions about whether or not Cairo should be considered independent because of historical links between England and Palestine during World War II. During this era, some members of Congress demanded full American control of all Middle Eastern territories so they could fight against Germany if war were declared again. They also opposed any treaty allowing Israel to exist outside their land grant boundaries. So while most Americans supported these demands, others criticized them as unpatriotic and even racist. By 1960, President John F Kennedy had made clear his objection to such proposals but he did nothing to stop them until 1971, when he finally took action towards ending the hostilities. Since then, Egypt has grown economically due to trade agreements signed with other nations like China and India. While political turmoil continues within the nation, economic growth rates remain high despite challenges posed by terrorism and internal divisions among Egyptians themselves.
