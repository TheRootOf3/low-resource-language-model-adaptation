Context:Wikitania is an imaginary country created during the early development stages of Wikipedia. Its capital city is New York City. While not specifically mentioned or even described anywhere else within the text, it has been confirmed that it exists due to historical research conducted prior to the launch of the project. During this time period, there were numerous reports suggesting that "New World" could be used as a title for such a nation based upon various factors extracted from ancient texts including Mesoamerica, Egyptology, and Ancient Greece. This idea became popularized after reading about the United States' declaration of independence following their struggle against British rule. As seen in the article below, the term 'United States' can refer both formally and informally to the entire continent known as North American Empire.


The question comes down to whether you're referring to the actual entity or just the fictional one made up out of whole cloth. If we are talking about the real thing then I would say that it should have been specified explicitly given how many people read into these articles without knowing who they really belong to despite having written them themselves. However if we are using your revised version where the new world refers only to the USA then my answer will change slightly since the previous statement
